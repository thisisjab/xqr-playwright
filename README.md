# X Scraper

This simple script finds all accounts that have quoted or replied a tweet.

## Usage Instructions

Make sure you have python 3.11 installed. Any later version is suitable.

Install playwright using:

```shell
pip install playwright
```

or If you have poetry (recommended):

```shell
poetry install
```

Then fill out your account info in the script and the tweet URL. Add `quotes/` at the end.

## Notes

- You can adjust some settings in the script based on your network connection. Also you can use proxy.
- Do not use your own account; it may be blocked.
- This script is written in hurry. Sorry for my spaghetti code.
